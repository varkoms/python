# List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:

```python
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

## The Syntax

```python
newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
```

The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using:

```python
squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))
```

or, equivalently:

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

which is more concise and readable.

A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal:

```python
[(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
```

and itâ€™s equivalent to:

```python
combs = []
for x in [1,2,3]:
    for y in [3,1,4]:
        if x != y:
            combs.append((x, y))
combs
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
```
