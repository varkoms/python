# Lambdas

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only
have one expression.

## Syntax

```
lambda arguments : expression
```

The expression is executed and the result is returned:

## Example

Add 10 to argument a, and return the result:

```python
x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))
```

Lambda functions can take any number of arguments.

## Example

Multiply argument a with argument b and return the result

```python
x = lambda a,b : a * b
print(x(5, 6))
```
