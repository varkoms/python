# A Short Program: Zigzag

Let’s use the programming concepts you’ve learned so far to create a small animation program. This program will create a back-and-forth, zigzag pattern until the user stops it by pressing the Mu editor’s Stop button or by pressing CTRL-C. When you run this program, the output will look something like this:

```zsh
    ********
   ********
  ********

```
